<p><img src="/images/tor.jpg" alt="tor" title="Talk about Tor by Lunar during 2014 RMLL Security Track in Montpellier - photo CC BY-NC-SA by P. Teuwen"></p>
<p>After many years of curation of the <a href="https://prog2017.rmll.info/spip.php?page=rmll_progall&amp;lang=en&amp;t=2">Security Track</a> of the <a href="http://rmll.info/">RMLL</a> (a French generalist multi tracks conference about Free Software), we have decided to create in 2018 a free (as in free beer) event dedicated to Security and Free Software: Pass the SALT, Security And Libre Talks.</p>
<p>We have decided to do it because as a technical track, we no more felt &ldquo;at home&rdquo; in a conference that went more year after year toward a artistic, political and communities direction. This direction was very interesting for the RMLL but too far from our core topic to feel comfortable enough as track curators but also for the event organizers.</p>
<p>We are convinced of the value that Free Software provides to all of us, citizens of the world, in the Security area. And having a conference dedicated to it is a way for us to contribute to its expansion.</p>
<p>On this page, we will expose our goals for this new conference and the way we want to follow to reach them.</p>
<h2 id="our-goals-for-pass-the-salt">Our goals for Pass the SALT</h2>
<p><img src="/images/werner.jpg" alt="werner, éric and françois" title="Discussion between François Marier, Eric Leblond and Werner Koch during 2013 RMLL Security Track in Brussels - photo CC BY-NC-SA by P. Teuwen"></p>
<p>To understand the objectives and the spirit, Peter Czanik, lecturer, gave us some answers in the <a href="https://www.balabit.com/blog/czp-rmll-libre-software-meeting-2017/">report of his participation in the RMLL 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Here is how he summarized his coming at the 2017 RMLL Security track:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I participated again in Security track &hellip; “<strong>Participated</strong>” as I did not only give a talk on syslog-ng there, but also sat in to most of the presentations and had <strong>very good discussions both with visitors and fellow speakers</strong>. The organizers brought together <strong>talks from diverse IT security-related fields</strong>, a very good opportunity for <strong>cross-pollination of ideas</strong>&rdquo;. (Note: emphasis is on our own)</em></p>
<p>Peter has perfectly synthesized what we are trying to achieve through the RMLL Security track  year after year:</p>
<p><em>Do our best to facilitate meetings and exchanges between lecturers and the public. The goal is that these exchanges generate collaborations between developers or projects but also produce new features in free software of the Security sphere.</em></p>
<p>And it is what we will want to achieve year after year with Pass the SALT.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-reach-our-goals">How to reach our goals</h2>
<p>Here, we are not going to give a detailed list of things we think that have to be done but rather, a short list of important (according to us) levers that helped us reaching these goals.</p>
<p><strong>1&gt; Cost: a free access event</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
First of all, we want to <strong>provide a free event to attendees</strong>. According to us, this is the best way to enable all kind of attendees to come : we think about students or people with low income but it is also a way to see professionals coming on their own without having to negociate money with their company.</p>
<p><strong>2&gt; Content: an event with most of the security topics covered &amp; a hybrid talks selection model</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
While respecting the technical and free software DNA of the conference, we try to ensure that <strong>as many security disciplines as possible are represented</strong> in the topics covered by the talks and workshops.</p>
<p>During the first 2 Pass the SALT editions, we managed to offer many different sessions with among other topics: low level security, offensive security, secure programming, security at scale, privacy or network security. In 2023, we create 2 new sessions about Boot Security and Supply Chain Security.</p>
<p>We want both <strong>attendees and speakers to confront to different disciplines and topics of Security</strong> that are not always familiar to them. This allows everyone to discover new fields of exploration and to pick innovative solutions that she/he can reuse in her/his projects or work.</p>
<p><strong>Pass the SALT talks selection model</strong></p>
<p>We mix a public call for paper (CFP) with a small number of invited talks.</p>
<p>Why doing it in such a way?</p>
<p>Running a public CFP allows everybody to submit and brings more diversity into the talks and speakers lineup. On the other hand, invited talks are a way for us to give exposure to topics and/or speakers that, according to the org team, deserve it.
However, invited talks are an adjustment variable and the vast majority (80% min) of the event content comes from the CFP. Invited talks have to be seen as a “Director cut” feature for the organization team in order to give a “color” to its event 😇</p>

<p><strong>3&gt; For attendees: an open minded and accessible atmosphere</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Beyond the different and varied subjects, we also try to establish a climate as friendly as possible in order to maximize exchanges. During the conference, it is very rare to find a &ldquo;star attitude&rdquo; among our speakers. They are all free software users and/or developers and so, perfectly understand the importance of sharing with and helping people. So, we set up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pauses:</strong> during which, we do our best to <strong>encourage attendees to interact with speakers</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>social event:</strong> organization provides some (usually 2) free drinks and tries to encourage one more time exchanges between people :)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4&gt; For speakers: a comfortable and caring event</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It is also very important for us that the <strong>speakers feel comfortable</strong> for coming and attending : they usually don&rsquo;t know the event (and so its attendees), the city and even sometimes the country.</p>
<p>To acheive this goal, we provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a dedicated communication channel:</strong> on a private mailing list we provide complete information (how to come, to find accommodations, to do their talk, to contact us, to be reimbursed etc.),</li>
<li><strong>a full contact list and fast feedback loop:</strong> in order to be able to get in touch and have answers quickly from the org team,</li>
<li><strong>a speakers dinner:</strong> during the event, we also set up a speakers&rsquo; dinner. The goal is to provide them yet another opportunity to get to know each other better, exchange and let ideas &ldquo;pollinate&rdquo; :-)</li>
<li><strong>some gifts:</strong> in 2023, we have decided to thank our speakers for their work by offering them a few gifts (local biscuits, chocolates &hellip;). We will see in the future if our budget will allow us to pursue this initiative.</li>
<li><strong>transport costs reimbursement:</strong> we try to reimburse the transports costs to speakers with low ressources and not backed by a company. In particular, we don&rsquo;t want to endorse recent changes seen among large tech companies which cut very aggressively their employees travel budget. We monitor the situation and hope these very profitable companies will soon return to a fairer attitude towards conferences and their employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is for all lecturers to come in confidence, get rid of most of their practical questions to be able to take advantage of the event in the most open way.</p>
