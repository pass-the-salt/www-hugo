## Contributions
Here is a "living" list, certainly not exhaustive, of the contributions and interactions born from these moments of exchanges during our conferences.

* **2024**:
  * **code** - Quentin JEROME, during his [talk](https://cfp.pass-the-salt.org/pts2024/talk/VLT987/) about [Kuna√Ø](https://why.kunai.rocks/), has received a feature request about logs rotation. He [announced](https://infosec.exchange/@kunai_project/112812265470615674), only 15 days after, that this [feature](https://why.kunai.rocks/docs/configuration#log-rotation) has been implemented! 
  * **code** - Quentin [implemented](https://github.com/kunai-project/kunai/releases/tag/v0.3.0-alpha.2) a second proposal done during the event, by [@regiteric](https://x.com/Regiteric) this time, about [Community ID](https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec) - Congrats Quentin üëè and thanks for the notifications üôè
  * **code** - [Yves Rutschle](https://www.rutschle.net/), after attending #pts22 [Micka√´l Sala√ºn's talk about Landlock](https://cfp.pass-the-salt.org/pts2022/talk/BGQGZC/), has added Landlock support to his project [sslh](https://github.com/yrutschle/sslh/) in version [2.1.0](https://github.com/yrutschle/sslh/releases/tag/v2.1.0). Thanks Yves and congrats for this implementation!
* **2023**:
  * **idea/code** - [Alexandre Dulaunoy](https://twitter.com/adulau) from [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/), [decided](https://twitter.com/adulau/status/1677661654127968258) to add OpenWRT images to CIRCL's [Hashlookup](https://hashlookup.io/) service and Free Software according to a suggestion given by [Elo√Øse Brocas](https://twitter.com/_cryptocorn_) during the Q/A session of the [Hashlookup talk](https://cfp.pass-the-salt.org/pts2023/talk/NQY3WL/).

  * **speaker comeback** - After starting their speaker journey (~) in our conference respectively during [#RMLLSec2016](https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/RMLL%20Security%20Tracks/2016/videos/RMLL-Sec-2016-manalyze-a-static-analyzer-for-pe-files__high.mp4) and [#RMLLSec2017](https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/RMLL%20Security%20Tracks/2017/videos/RMLL-Sec-2017-lief_63569_720p.mp4), [Ivan Kwiatkowski](https://twitter.com/JusticeRage/) came this year to deliver a brilliant [Keynote](https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/Pass%20the%20SALT/2022/videos/PTS2022-Talk-10-ethics-in-cyberwar-times.mp4) and [Romain Thomas](https://twitter.com/rh0main) to show us [the huge progress of the LIEF capabilities](https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/Pass%20the%20SALT/2022/videos/PTS2022-Talk-14-the-poor-mans-obfuscator.mp4), his security FLOSS project started 5 years earlier. We couldn't be prouder than to see these two young yet so experienced security researchers return to the scene of their debut. Hats off!
  * **IRL conference speaker debut** - On the starter side, we are very pleased to have hosted the first IRL Security conference talk given by Claire Vacherot, [Pierre Milioni](https://twitter.com/b1two_) and [Hugo Vincent](https://twitter.com/hugow_vincent).

* **2018**:
  * **code** - After putting [RetDec developers](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/schedule/#retdec) and [Radare2 devs](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/schedule/#r2frida) in touch during 2018 edition of Pass the SALT, RetDec developers demontrates at r2con 2019 [initial RetDec integration into Radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/r2con2019/blob/master/talks/r2retdec/slides.pdf).

  * **sharing** - ‚Äã‚Äã[Peter Czanik](https://twitter.com/PCzanik) will try to use Syslog-NG and MISP together after a discussion with [Rapha√´l Vinot](https://twitter.com/rafi0t) during the speakers' dinner.
* **2016**:
  * **sharing** - Let's Encrypt through [J.C. Jones](https://tacticalsecret.com/) provides [the information that they use Qubes as the secure platform to do all ops on Let's encrypt PKI](https://twitter.com/QubesOS/status/750283841743577088). Great use case for a great product.
* **2015**:
  * **code** - [Paul Kocialkowski](http://paulk.fr/), developer of Replicant (Android full free) and embedded theme speaker, attended on Monday [Lunar conference on reproducible builds](https://2015.rmll.info/compilations-reproductibles-dans-debian-et-partout-ailleurs?lang=en) in the Security track.

Henri also presented this year in the Security track and met Eric on this occasion.
* **2011**:
