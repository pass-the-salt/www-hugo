As said in "About" page, Pass the SALT founders have curated during 10 years the Security track of the RMLL (French generalist FLOSS conference). It has been such a great experience with lot of good memories, friends and talks. You will find below the slides since 2008 (with some pics and interviews). Videos are also available since their recording beginning in 2012.
